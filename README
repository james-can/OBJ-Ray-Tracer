As of now the name of the obj to be rendered as well as output file are hardcoded into main.cpp under the "fname" variable, output image gets saved into "Output" folder. In the future will add gui options for this. There are currently are obj, mtl and texture files included which are rendered by default. Also to be added, and option to reset and specify a new file without need to reinitialize the program.

Needs to be run on x86 platform.

Here are some sample outputs:
